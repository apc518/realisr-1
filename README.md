# Realisr
Standalone python script for my app Realisr: https://chamberlainmusic.herokuapp.com/realisr.
This may be helpful if you want to run Realisr on big files, or of course if you want to just mess around with the code.

### Usage
You must have the `playsound` and `matplotlib` modules installed. If you don't, simply use `pip install playsound` or `pip install matplotlib`.

Clone or download the repo and run `python realisr.py` (This may be `py realisr.py` or `python3 realisr.py` depending on your system).

### Settings
To change settings that are not part of the default prompt, edit realisr_settings.json.

This python script is not meant to be a production application. This is just for tinkerers or people who want to use Realisr on giant files.
