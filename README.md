Standalone python script for my app Realisr: https://chamberlainmusic.azurewebsites.net/realisr.
This may be helpful if you want to run Realisr on big files, or of course if you want to just mess around with the code.

To use this, simply put wavparser.py, realisr_settings.json, and realisr.py in a directory, and run `python realisr` in the directory.

To change settings that are not part of the default prompt, edit realisr_settings.json.

This python script is not meant to be a production application. This is just for tinkerers or people who want to use Realisr on giant files.
